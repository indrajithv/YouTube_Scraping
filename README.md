# YouTube Scraping

This Python project aims to learn how to interact with the YouTube Data API by scraping YouTube data. The project involves extracting data from the API in JSON format, loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame, and visualizing it using the Seaborn library.

## Overview

Scraping data from YouTube allows us to gather insights into trending videos, popular channels, viewer engagement, and much more. By leveraging the YouTube Data API, we can access a wealth of information about videos, channels, playlists, and user activities.

## Methodology

This project follows a simple methodology:

1. **API Interaction**:
   - Utilizing the YouTube Data API to fetch data such as video details, channel information, comments, etc.

2. **Data Extraction**:
   - Extracting relevant information from the API response, typically in JSON format.
   - Parsing the JSON data and transforming it into a structured format suitable for analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Loading the extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
   - Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the YouTube data.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Creating visualizations using the Seaborn library to illustrate trends, patterns, or relationships within the data.
   - Visualizing metrics such as video views, likes, comments, channel subscribers, etc.

## Key Components:

- **YouTube Data API**: Provides access to YouTube data, including videos, channels, playlists, and user activities.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, including loading data into DataFrames.
- **Seaborn**: A powerful visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, used for creating attractive and informative visualizations.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in Python, making use of libraries such as requests, pandas, and seaborn. The YouTube Data API requires an API key, which needs to be obtained from the Google Cloud Console. The code interacts with the API to fetch data, processes it, and then visualizes it using Seaborn.

## Conclusion

By scraping data from YouTube using the YouTube Data API and visualizing it with Seaborn, this project provides insights into YouTube trends and user engagement. It serves as a practical exercise in API interaction, data manipulation, and data visualization.
